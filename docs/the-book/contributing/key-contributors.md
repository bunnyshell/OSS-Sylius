# Key Contributors

### Introduction

The Sylius Key Contributors program is an initiative designed to actively engage and recognize community members who contribute significantly to the Sylius ecosystem. This program replaces previous structures to create a more inclusive, transparent, and rewarding experience for contributors.

The program's goal is to encourage collaboration, celebrate contributions, and ensure a thriving open-source ecosystem around Sylius.

### What Does Being a Key Contributor Mean?

Key Contributors are community members whose efforts have a significant impact on the Sylius project. As a Key Contributor, you’ll receive:

* **Permissions**:
  * “Write” access to public Sylius repositories.
  * “Triage” access to private repositories, like Sylius/Plus.
* **Recognition**:
  * An online certificate acknowledging your contributions.
  * Exclusive Sylius Key Contributor merchandise.
* **Collaboration Opportunities**:
  * Regular meetings with the Sylius Development Team.
  * Access to the private `#key-contributors` Slack channel.
  * Influence on project decisions.
* **Support**:
  * Assistance from the Sylius Development Team on coding or presentations.
  * Approval to showcase your role as a Key Contributor on your LinkedIn profile.

### How to Qualify as a Key Contributor

Key Contributors are selected quarterly based on their activities and contributions. Here's what we evaluate:

* Submitted Pull Requests.
* Reviews of Pull Requests.
* Filed GitHub issues.
* Engagement in GitHub and Slack discussions.
* Resolving community support requests on Slack (#support), StackOverflow, and GitHub.
* Writing blog posts for the Sylius website.

Active contributors who meet these criteria are invited to join the program for a three-month term, with reevaluation occurring after the end of each quarter.
